# Miku-Tabs

Ever wished your new tab page was cuter? **Miku-Tabs** is a Chrome extension that makes every new tab betterâ€”because it adds Miku! ðŸ’™ðŸŽ¶

Say goodbye to boring new tabs and hello to a touch of Hatsune Mikuâ€™s charm every time you open your browser. âœ¨

## **1. Install Miku-Tabs via GitHub**

Since **Miku-Tabs** is not available on the Google Chrome Web Store, you can install it manually from GitHub. Follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

First, you need to clone the **Miku-Tabs** repository from GitHub. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SirPigari/miku.git
```

This will create a local copy of the repository in a folder named `miku` on your computer.

### **Step 2: Open Chrome and Go to Extensions**

1. Open **Google Chrome**.
2. In the address bar, type [`chrome://extensions/`](chrome://extensions) and press **Enter**.
3. Toggle the **Developer mode** switch in the top right corner to enable it.

### **Step 3: Load the Extension Locally**

1. Click on the **Load unpacked** button.
2. In the file picker window, navigate to the folder where you cloned the **Miku-Tabs** repository. By default, it will be in your home directory or wherever you ran the clone command (the folder is called `miku`).
3. Select the `miku` folder and click **Select Folder**.

The extension will now be installed and active on your browser! ðŸŽ‰
